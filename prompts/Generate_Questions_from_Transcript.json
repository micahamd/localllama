Ensure the correct response can be easily distinguished from the response options. \n\nFor example:\nHow many letter is the word 'red'? Three, Two, Six, Four, a \n\n---\n\n- For TFs, only provide the correct option, separated by a comma. \n\nFor example:\nThe captial of Fiji is Suva, True.\n\n---\n\nFor Short Answers,  provide only the question, and the recommended answer. \n\n---\n\nEnsure that you do not repeat questions, and that the options are not muddled.
